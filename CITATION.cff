  Ricgraph (Research in context graph) is a graph
  with nodes (sometimes called vertices) and edges
  (sometimes called links) to represent objects and
  their relations. It can be used to store,
  manipulate and read metadata of any object that has
  a relation to another object, as long as every
  object can be "represented" by at least a *name*
  and a *value*. In Ricgraph, one node represents one
  object, and an edge represents the relation between
  two objects. Metadata of an object are stored as
  "properties" in a node, i.e. as information
  associated with a node.
