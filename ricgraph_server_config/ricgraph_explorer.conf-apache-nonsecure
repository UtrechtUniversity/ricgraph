# This file is an example Apache configuration file, containing a
# VirtualHost for both Ricgraph Explorer,
# a web based tool to access Ricgraph, and the Ricgraph REST API.
#
# This is a very basic Apache config file, intended for the case
# where you only need unsecure access (http, port 80).
# Note that this is usually not what you would want.
# If you need a secure config file, use the other Apache
# config file 'ricgraph_explorer.conf-apache'.
#
# Apache proxies to a local host and port (see below). On that host/port 
# runs the WSGI Gunicorn server using Uvicorn for ASGI applications.
# That is done, since a ASGI application server is good practise for 
# a REST API.
#
# READ THIS:
# To prevent accidental exposure of data in Ricgraph to the outside world,
# the lines starting with 'ProxyPass' have been commented.
# Please read the warning above and take appropriate
# measures before uncommenting it and starting Apache.
#
# Original version Rik D.T. Janssen, February, May 2024, May 2025.
