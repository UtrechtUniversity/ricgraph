_Ricgraph: A flexible and extensible graph to explore research in context from various systems_

**Abstract**

Ricgraph, also known as Research in context graph, enables the exploration of researchers, teams, their 
results, collaborations, skills, projects, and the relations between these items.

Ricgraph can store many types of items into a single graph. These items can be obtained from various 
systems and from multiple organizations. Ricgraph facilitates reasoning about these items because it 
infers new relations between items, relations that are not present in any of the separate source systems. 
Ricgraph is flexible and extensible, and can be adapted to new application areas.

In this article, we illustrate how Ricgraph works by applying it to the application area research information.
