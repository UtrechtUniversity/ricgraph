Dear colleague,

This newsletter tells you about some recent developments around Ricgraph. If you would like to have a 
presentation or demo, or would like to discuss how Ricgraph can help you for your specific use case, 
please do not hesitate to contact me. Please feel free to share this newsletter with anyone you might think 
is interested. 

**What is Ricgraph**

Ricgraph, also known as Research in context graph, enables the exploration of researchers, teams, their 
results, collaborations, skills, projects, and the relations between these items.

Ricgraph can store many types of items into a single graph. These items can be obtained from various 
systems and from multiple organizations. Ricgraph facilitates reasoning about these items because it 
infers new relations between items, relations that are not present in any of the separate source systems. 
Ricgraph is flexible and extensible, and can be adapted to new application areas.

**Some recent developments**

*	Ricgraph now has a website on www.ricgraph.eu.
*	There is a new standard presentation explaining Ricgraph: 
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634234.
*	There is also a presentation "Enriching Pure data using Ricgraph -Research in context graph- 
and BackToPure": https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634658.
*	You also might want to read the reference publication: Rik D.T. Janssen (2024). Ricgraph: A 
flexible and extensible graph to explore research in context from various systems. SoftwareX, 
26(101736). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101736.
*	Ricgraph now has a REST API. You can use the Ricgraph REST API to get data from Ricgraph, 
or to execute predefined queries in Ricgraph and Ricgraph Explorer. The advantage of a REST 
API is that your code is not dependent on any Ricgraph code. 
*	Many other changes. Ricgraph is now on version v2.3. To see a full overview of all changes, go 
to the releases page: https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph/releases.
