# Documentation Ricgraph - Research in context graph

## What is Ricgraph?

Ricgraph, also known as Research in context graph, enables the exploration of researchers, 
teams, their results,
collaborations, skills, projects, and the relations between these items.

Ricgraph can store many types of items into a single graph. 
These items can be obtained from various systems and from
multiple organizations. Ricgraph facilitates reasoning about these 
items because it infers new relations between items,
relations that are not present in any of the separate source systems. 
It is flexible and extensible, and can be
adapted to new application areas.
