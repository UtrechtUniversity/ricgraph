## Query and visualize Ricgraph

To query and visualize Ricgraph nodes and edges, there are several possibilities:
* First you have to [start Neo4j Desktop](#start-neo4j-desktop).
* Then you can query and visualize using:
  * Ricgraph explorer, read [How to use Ricgraph explorer](#How-to-use-ricgraph-explorer).
  * Bloom, read [How to use Bloom](#How-to-use-bloom).
  * Other methods for querying and visualization are 
    [Future work](ricgraph_future_work.md).

### Start Neo4j Desktop

1. Click on the downloaded AppImage. It will be called something
  like *neo4j-desktop-X.Y.Z-x86_64.AppImage*, where *X.Y.Z* is a version number.
1. At the top right there is a text "No active DBMS".
1. Move your mouse to the text "Graph DBMS". When you hoover it, a button
  will appear with the text "Start". Click it.
1. Wait until the Neo4j graph database engine has started.
  It may ask for a password that has
  been changed. Enter the password you have used
  while creating your database. Click "Save". 
1. Now, next to the text "Graph DBMS" a green icon appears with
  the text "ACTIVE". Your graph database engine is active and ready for use.

### How to use Ricgraph explorer

Ricgraph explorer is a web based explorer for Ricgraph. You can use it to search for nodes
based on the node properties *name*, *category* and/or *value*. Ricgraph explorer will
present a simple form where you can enter one or more of these values. 
As result, all objects related to your search value(s) will be returned in the form
of a table.
Also, if you have searched for a *person*, all of its identifiers will be returned.
You can go to other nodes by clicking on a value in the *value* column. By doing this, 
you are traversing the graph.

Ricgraph explorer also offers 
[Faceted navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search). 
That means, if a query results in a table with e.g. *journal articles*, *datasets*,
and *software*, you can narrow down on one or more of these categories by 
checking or unchecking their corresponding checkbox.

#### Execute queries

To use Ricgraph explorer, follow these steps:
1. [Start Neo4j Desktop](#Start-neo4j-desktop).
1. Run the *ricgraph_explorer.py* script in directory [ricgraph_explorer](../ricgraph_explorer).
  It will tell you which weblink and port to use, probably
  http://127.0.0.1:3030. Open a webbrowser and go to that link.

To use it:
* There are two search forms, choose one:
  * a case-sensitive, exact match search on fields 
  *name*, *category* and/or *value* fields; 
  * a search on field *value* containing a string.
* In the search form, enter one or more values in the fields available. 
* Click on "Search".
* The result, that is, all objects related to your search value(s),
  will be presented in a table. You can go to other nodes
  by clicking a value in the *value* column.

### How to use Bloom

[Bloom is Neo4j's graph visualization tool](https://neo4j.com/product/bloom).
It is included with Neo4j Desktop.
According to Neo4j it is:
"A beautiful and expressive data visualization tool to quickly explore and freely interact with
Neo4jâ€™s graph data platform with no coding required".
Neo4j has
[extensive documentation how to use Bloom](https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current)
and a 
[Bloom overview](https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/2.6/bloom-visual-tour/bloom-overview).
Below are some examples for a quick start.

#### Open Bloom

1. [Start Neo4j Desktop](#Start-neo4j-desktop).
1. Click on the icon
  <img src="images/neo4j1.jpg" height="20">
  on the left side of Neo4j Desktop.
1. Click on "Neo4j Bloom". A new window appears.

#### Execute queries

The [Ricgraph Bloom configuration file](ricgraph_install_configure.md#install-bloom-configuration)
contains four different shortcuts for
[Cypher queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypher_(query_language)):

* "Node name \[value of node to find\]": finds a node
  where property *name* of a node has value *\[value of node to find\]*.
* "Node category \[value of node to find\]": similar to
  "Node name ..." for property *category*.
* "Node value \[value of node to find\]": similar to
  "Node name ..." for property *value*.
* "Node comment \[value of node to find\]": similar to
  "Node name ..." for property *comment*.

These queries can be entered in the Bloom text box "Search graph",
by typing e.g. "Node name ORCID" or "Node category dataset".
For more information see
[Bloom search bar](https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/2.6/bloom-visual-tour/search-bar)
and [Boom pattern
search](https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current/bloom-tutorial/graph-pattern-search).

Nodes found can be examined or expanded as described in the section
[Actions while clicking on a node](#Actions-while-clicking-on-a-node).
The result will be visualized as described in section
[Visualization of nodes](#Visualization-of-nodes).

#### Actions while clicking on a node

The following are some examples of actions while clicking on a node:

* Double left-click on a node: the properties of a node are shown in a window.
* Right-click right on a node, choose "Expand", choose "All": The node will be
  expanded with all nodes connected to it.
* Multiple nodes can be selected by selecting one node, holding the
  Control key and selecting other nodes.
* Right-click on a node, choose "Dismiss": This node will
  be removed from the visualization.
* Right-click on a node, choose "Dismiss other nodes": All other nodes will
  be removed from the visualization.
* For other actions, see
  [Bloom actions](https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/2.6/bloom-visual-tour/search-bar/#_actions).

#### Visualization of nodes

Nodes can be visualized in different ways, by changing e.g. their
size or color. This can be changed as follows:

1. On the right side of the Bloom window, there is
  an icon <img src="images/neo4j3.jpg" height="20">. Click it
  (Neo4j has [extensive documentation how to use
  it](https://neo4j.com/docs/bloom-user-guide/current/bloom-visual-tour/perspective-drawer)).
1. A new window appears. It shows the default settings for the display
  of nodes. You can change the color, size, the property to
  show on the node, and the icon.
1. In the tab "Rule-based" you can add your own rules.

The [Ricgraph Bloom configuration file](ricgraph_install_configure.md#install-bloom-configuration)
contains a few rules based on the value of properties.
Rules which determine the color of a node:

* if property *category* = "person": color = blue.
* if property *category* = "dataset": color = green.
* if property *category* = "journal article": color = yellow.
* if property *category* = "software": color = red.
* all other nodes: color = grey.

Rules which determine the size of a node:

* if property *url_main* contains "uu01": size of the node = small. This indicates
  which nodes have been harvested from
  the data repository [Yoda](https://search.datacite.org/repositories/delft.uu).
* if property *url_other* contains "research-software-directory": size of the node = large.
  This indicates which nodes have been harvested from
  the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org).
* all other nodes: size = medium.
