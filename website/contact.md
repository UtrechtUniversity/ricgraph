He is also very interested in working together on projects involving Ricgraph. 
Ricgraph is a flexible platform that brings
together information from multiple systems into a single graph. 
It allows users to analyze this information and explore how it relates
to other types of information.
We could work together on use cases applying Ricgraph to
research information, such as exploring collaborations or
analyzing how people or organizations contribute to research results.
We could also explore entirely different domains. 
Any application that involves representing and analyzing
interconnected information as nodes and relations in a graph, 
regardless of the field, is of interest.

About three to four times a year we send out a newsletter.
