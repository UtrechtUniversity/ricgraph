He is also very interested in collaborating on projects involving Ricgraph. 
Ricgraph is a flexible platform that brings
together information from multiple systems into a single graph, 
allowing users to explore and analyze this information and their relationships.
Collaborations could focus on applying Ricgraph to
research information, such as exploring collaborations 
and contributions, or analyzing networks.
They could also explore entirely different domains. 
Any application that involves representing and analyzing
interconnected information as nodes and relationships in a graph, 
regardless of the field, is of interest
