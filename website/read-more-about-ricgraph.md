# Read more about Ricgraph

* For a gentle introduction in Ricgraph, please read the reference publication:
  Rik D.T. Janssen (2024). Ricgraph: A flexible and extensible graph to explore
  research in context from various systems. *SoftwareX*, 26(101736).
  [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101736](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101736).
* You can read the general presentation about Ricgraph, presenting Ricgraph in
  a visual   manner:
  [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634234](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634234).
* You can read the presentation explaining how to enrich the [Research
  Information System Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure)
  (and other source systems) using Ricgraph
  and [BackToPure](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/BackToPure):
  [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634658](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634658).
  This presentation explains that after harvesting several Pure's
  (from different institutions)  and other source systems,
  such as [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org),
  one can enrich its own Pure _A_ by using information in other source
  systems, not present in one's own Pure _A_.
* Extensive documentation and source code can be found in the [GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph).
