# Read more about Ricgraph

There are several places where you can start reading about Ricgraph:

* For a gentle introduction in Ricgraph, please read the reference publication:
  Rik D.T. Janssen (2024). *Ricgraph: A flexible and extensible graph to explore
  research in context from various systems*. SoftwareX, 26(101736).
  [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101736](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2024.101736).
* We also have an article about collaborations and Ricgraph:
  Rik D.T. Janssen (2025).
  *Utilizing Ricgraph to gain insights into research collaborations across institutions,
  at every organizational level*. Submitted to PLOS One [preprint].
  [https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5524439](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5524439).
* You can read the general presentation about Ricgraph, presenting Ricgraph in
  a visual   manner:
  [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634234](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634234).
* You can read the presentation explaining how to enrich the [Research
  Information System Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure)
  (and other source systems) using Ricgraph
  and [BackToPure](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/BackToPure):
  [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634658](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12634658).
  This presentation explains that after harvesting several Pures
  (from different institutions)  and other source systems,
  such as [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org),
  one can enrich its own Pure _A_ by using information in other source
  systems, not present in one's own Pure _A_.
* Extensive documentation and source code can be found on the
  [Ricgraph documentation website](https://docs.ricgraph.eu), or
  in the [GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/ricgraph).
