# Pilot project Open Ricgraph demo server

> Starting around mid-September, we will launch the Open Ricgraph demo server.
> You can find its URL on this page.


## Aim of the pilot project
The aim of the pilot project is to demonstrate how Ricgraph
can provide insights into research relations and collaborations, and how it can
optimize the quality of research information. 

The approach we take is to collect research information from participating
organizations and from multiple source systems, and to combine it in a single
graph. By organizing research information in a network of connected items and
relations, users can infer new relations, relations that are not present in any
of the source systems. 
The result is openly available to anyone, in accordance with the open science
principles. 

## Contents of the pilot
In this pilot project, we are starting with a few Dutch universities. 
[Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en)
will facilitate these organizations to construct a graph containing
their research information. It will include information on researchers, teams,
their results, (sub-)organizations, collaborations, (optional) skills,
(optional) projects, and the relations between these items. 

This graph is
constructed based on the contents of 
the [Research Information System Pure](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure) of
each participating organization, supplemented with research information from
sources such as the publication and data set aggregator
[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org),
the data repository [Yoda](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/yoda), and
the [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org).


The participating organizations will explore the potential and will investigate
what can be learned from research information in a single graph. 
This project consists of three parts: 

* Utrecht University will make available an Open Ricgraph demo server containing 
  research information from the participating organizations. 
* Pilot A: Participating organizations can enrich Pure data using Ricgraph 
  and [BackToPure](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/backtopure). 
  BackToPure can insert (enrich) items from an organization 
  that are absent from the Pure of that organization but are present in 
  another source, back into the Pure of that organization.
* Pilot B: Participating organizations can explore collaborations between 
  sub-organizations (faculties, departments, chairs) using Ricgraph.

## Participate in the pilot project
In September 2025, the Open Ricgraph demo server will start with 
research information
from the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en).

If your organization would like to participate, there are three things 
that require your attention and time:

* Preparation for the pilot.
  * Your organization and Utrecht University need to sign two agreements: 
    a *Agreement to host a pilot Open Ricgraph demo server*, and a 
    *Data Processing Agreement*.
    The effort required for this depends on how closely your organization's 
    insights on legal and privacy policies align with those of Delft University
    of Technology. 
    You can find more information (including the agreements with
    Delft University of Technology) in section 1.6 and chapter 5 
    of the document above.
  * Your organization needs a *privacy statement* related to this pilot project.
    Possibly the general privacy statement of your organization suffices.
    Your organization might also need additional *privacy measures*
    (beyond those required by Delft University of Technology), 
    and you may wish to conduct a *data classification*. 
    These topics are also described in chapter 5
    of the document above.
* Execution of the pilot.
  * Someone of your organization needs to participate in the project group, 
    needs time for experimentation, and needs time for sharing findings. 
    In practice, this will take as much time as you are able 
    and willing to allocate, as described in section 1.7
    of the document above.
